## Abstract

This token standard enables tracking of products in a supply chain, facilitating traceability and communication of defects and recalls. It allows users to announce defects, check tokens, and forward recalls based on unique product IDs (TokenIDs). This standard supports incentive structures for faster recall responses and provides efficient recall management, communication, and traceability between various stakeholders in the supply chain, including customers.

## Motivation

Supply chain management often faces challenges in tracking and managing product recalls efficiently. Existing solutions can be cumbersome, slow, and costly. The token standard aims to improve the recall process, communication, and traceability between different parties in the supply chain. This standard also helps with managing customer integration and incentivizes faster responses to recalls.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Please see the provided Solidity interface for the detailed function specifications, events, and data structures.

        The `_announcer` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that currently owns the token
        The `_tokenId` argument MUST be the token being announced defect

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.
